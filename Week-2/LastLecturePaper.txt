In the Last Lecture video, there were some messages that affected me. One message that affected me was about following my dreams and that sometimes you will run into walls doing so. I had a lot of dreams as a kid, and most of them were trying to be an adult and have my own choices. One weird dream of mine was to learn and have as many pickled vegetables as I wanted. It was an easier dream to accomplish, but it still took a lot of love and commitment to learn and have. I had to have money for this dream and a stove that was not glass. I learned these skills when I was a teenager and still use them to this day, giving me an abundance of canned pickled items. I also wanted to go to college as a kid and get a higher education in something that I loved/liked, in high school I learned that, that was computer science and math, so I am pursuing it now. A lot of the messages in his video were to follow your dreams and to follow paths when they come or make them yourself, I identified with that because I had to make my own path to get where I am with a little help like he had. His message of asking for help from others spoke to me because if it wasn’t for others help, I wouldn’t be where I am. I liked the Last Lecture video it affected me and showed me a different way of looking at life and the help that I have received.
