Learning styles are important in how someone comprehends information. I found out that I am an Auditory learner, which was not surprising to hear since I thrive from hearing things in lectures, having a friend explain content, or even using a website that puts all of my reading into video with ASMR videos in the background to watch while I listen to the reading. I also found out that my second type of learning style was visual, which also makes sense because whenever I am listening to someone explain something, I like having diagrams, and I also draw out diagrams of how I want something to work before doing the project. I saw how important learning styles were when I was a Paraprofessional a year back when I used a lot of different techniques to help different students in their learning endeavors. Learning styles are not one or another, though, which is important because you can't always learn the same way every time in every environment. Things will change in classes, jobs, and other aspects of life, so you still need to be able to adapt and fall onto maybe your second type of learning style thatâ€™s not your best type but second best out of three.
