There are many differences between a Command Line Interface and Graphical User Interface. A Command Line Interface face is different from a Graphical User Interface, it is seen in a terminal which is a plan black box with text normally, this is where you can type in prompts or commands to add things like files and folders, it is also a place where you can run files and see outputs that it may create if it does depend on the file. This is a little more difficult to use as a comparison with how everything has to be perfectly typed in and you need to have the commands typed a specific way for them to work or work properly. A Graphical User Interface is different from a Command Line Interface because its face is interactive through an operating system, such as Windows and icons. This is like the main screen you see on your computer which is a lot easier to use but takes up a lot more memory and is slower most of the time comparison. You can also see what changes you are making a little easier on a Graphical User Interface compared to a Command Line User Interface.
